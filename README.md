# Auto 5e

This will be a collaboration of my ideas for autmating things for D&D 5e within Foundry VTT.

To install copy this link: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Reaver01/auto-5e-fvtt/master/auto-5e/module.json and paste it into Foundry on the install module screen.

# Current Features:

- Combat experience distribution
- Pan and select tokens on next turn
- Mark things deceased or not based on token hp
